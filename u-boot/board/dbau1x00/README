DbAu1000 is a development board from AMD containing
an Alchemy AU1000 with mips32 core.

Limitations & comments
----------------------
I assume that you set board to BIG endian!
Little endian not tested, most probably broken.

I named the board dbau1x00, to allow
support for all three development boards
some day ( dbau1000, dbau1100 and dbau1500 ).

I only have a dbau1000, so all testing is limited
to this board!

The board has two different flash banks, that can
be selected via dip switch. This makes it possible
to test new bootloaders without thrashing the YAMON
boot loader deliviered with board.

Ethernet only supported for mac0.

Pcmcia only supported for slot 0, only 3.3V.

Pcmcia IDE tested with Sandisk Compact Flash and
IBM microdrive.

If you partition a disk on another system (e.g. laptop),
all bytes will be swapped on 16bit level when using
PCMCIA!!!!

This is probably due to an error in Au1000 chip.

Solution:

a) Boot via network and partition disk directly from
dbau1x00. The endian will then be correct.

b) Partition disk on "laptop" and fill it with all files
you need. Then write a simple program that endian swaps
whole disk,

Example:
Original "laptop" byte order:
B0 B1 B2 B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9...

Dbau1000 byte order will then be:
B1 B0 B3 B2 B5 B4 B7 B6 B9 B8...
